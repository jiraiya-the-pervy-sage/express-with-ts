# ProjectBanaLe 🚀 ~sage

Welcome to **ProjectBanaLe**, where TypeScript meets Express in an exciting and dynamic way! This project is designed to get you up and running with a TypeScript-based Express app with minimal fuss and maximum fun. 🎉

## Getting Started 🌟

To get started with **ProjectBanaLe**, follow these funky steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository 📦

First, clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://your-repo-url-here.git
cd ProjectBanaLe
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies 🛠

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

This will install everything you need to get started.

### Step 3: Link the Package (Optional) 🔗

If you're developing locally and want to use the local version of your package, you can use:

```bash
npm link
```

This step is optional and can be skipped if you're just looking to get the project up and running.

### Step 4: Create Your Express App with TypeScript 🚀

Now, for the fun part! You can set up your Express app with TypeScript using one of the following commands:

**Option 1: Using a Global Package**

If you have `express-with-ts` installed globally, run:

```bash
node /var/root/.npm/_npx/d97150f6db63d3eb/node_modules/.bin/express-with-ts projectBanaLe
```

**Option 2: Using NPX**

Alternatively, you can use `npx` to run the command without installing the package globally:

```bash
npx express-with-ts projectBanaLe
```

### And Voilà! 🎉

You're all set! Your TypeScript Express project is ready for development. Dive in and start building something awesome.
